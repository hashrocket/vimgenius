Macros let you record a key sequence then play it again on different text.

To start recording a macro, type `q` then the register you want to save it to. It's easy to just do `qq`. Once you do this, you'll see "recording" in your status bar.

Next, you type the key sequence you want to save, then hit `q` again to stop recording.

To play your macro, type `@q`. To keep playing it, you can use the `.` command (this always repeats your last command).

You can also play a macro across a visual selection. Just make the selection, then type `:normal @q`. The normal stands for Normal mode. Note that you won't actually see the `:` after you type it, you'll see `'<,>'` intead since you will be in visual selection mode.

Here's a quick recap:

* `qq` to start recording
* `q` to stop recording
* `@q` to play the macro
