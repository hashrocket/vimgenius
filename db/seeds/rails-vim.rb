          directions: %q{If you use Rails, rails.vim is a must-know. It greatly simplifies navigation in a Rails app and it gives you many handy shortcuts.

Here's the basic gist of it:

* `:R` is the prefix for your main rails navigation commands.
* `:RV file_name` will do a vertical split
* `:RS file_name` will do a horizontal split
* `:RT file_name` will open the file in a new tab

There are commands that will take you to specific directories:

* `:Rview` or `Rvi` will give you views
* `:Rcontroller` or `Rco` will give you controllers
* `:Rmodel` or `Rmo` will give you models

These commands can be paired to create the following:

* `:RVvi home/index.html` would open index.html in a vertical split <br />
* `:RSmo user` would open user.rb in a horizontal split <br />
* `:RTco comments` would open comments_controller.rb in a new tab. <br />
* `:Rvi users/new.html` would open new.html, replacing whatever you have currently open.

`:A` gives you the "alternate" file for your currently open file. E.g., if you're in a model, and you type `:AV,` then the spec for that model will open up in a vertical split. Pretty nifty, right?

Ok, I hope you got all that, 'cause here's the quiz.
